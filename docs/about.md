The STEEL Team (Specifications and Testing for the Ethereum Execution Layer) is an Ethereum Foundation team in [Protocol](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/) that is responsible for maintaining Ethereum's Execution Layer [specifications](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/osaka/__init__.py.html), [consensus tests](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/) and EVM [benchmark tests](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/benchmark/).

Our main focus is ensuring **accurate specifications and comprehensive testing coverage** for the next [Ethereum hard fork](https://forkcast.org/). Alongside this work, we aim to **accelerate Ethereum development** by supporting researchers to implement specifications and tests proposed for subsequent forks and contribute to the effort to [**Scale the L1**](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/) by providing [computational- and state-intensive test cases](https://eest.ethereum.org/main/tests/benchmark/) that help client teams prepare for pathological scenarios and support Ethereum safely raise the block gas limit.

As such, our work is a deeply collaborative effort with many other teams in EF Protocol (such as [Prototyping](https://prototyping.ethereum.foundation/), [ethPandaOps](https://ethpandaops.io/), [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/), [Stateless Consensus](https://stateless.fyi/), [zkEVM](https://zkevm.ethereum.foundation/) and [Security](https://security.ethereum.org/)), the Mainnet Execution Layer client teams (e.g., Geth, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon, Reth) and other independent Ethereum researchers.

One of our major goals is to empower these Ethereum core developers to expedite Ethereum development. We aim to enable:

- **Researchers** by providing the best tooling to quickly prototype and verify specifications, facilitating the EIP inclusion process for future forks and enabling parallel development.
- **Client Developers** by providing new test formats and frameworks in order to quickly verify client functionality and easily debug problems when they arise.

We maintain the [ethereum/execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) repository which contains the EL specifications as executable code and the specification tests. You can learn more about our work on the [responsibilities page](responsibilities.md) or from our [previous presentations](https://github.com/ethsteel/presentations/blob/main/README.md).
